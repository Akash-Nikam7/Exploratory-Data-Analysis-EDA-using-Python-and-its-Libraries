# Exploratory Data Analysis on Road Accident Dataset 🚗📊

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a road accident dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help in improving road safety and reducing accident rates.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains records of road accidents with attributes like:
- Date and Time of accident
- Weather conditions
- Road surface conditions
- Light conditions
- Number of casualties
- Location information

*(You can link the dataset or mention the source if it's publicly available)*

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Code and analysis

## 📊 Key Analysis

- Distribution of accidents across different times of day  
- Impact of weather and road conditions on accident severity  
- Identification of accident hotspots  
- Correlation between variables such as speed limit, road type, and casualties

## 📌 Insights & Findings

- Accidents were more frequent during evening rush hours.  
- Poor weather and slippery roads significantly increased accident rates.  
- Specific junction types and road features were more prone to accidents.
